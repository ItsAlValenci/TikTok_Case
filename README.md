# TikTok Case Study Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics project developed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. The project focuses on analyzing TikTok video data to help identify claims versus opinions and improve content moderation processes.

## Project Overview

The TikTok case study is divided into four main components, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this component, we perform a thorough exploration of the TikTok dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and prepare it for further analysis. Key activities include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of video metrics
- Visualization of key relationships between variables
- Analysis of claim vs. opinion video characteristics
- Creation of Tableau dashboards for stakeholder presentations

### 2. A/B Testing and Hypothesis Testing

This component focuses on statistical analysis to test hypotheses about the TikTok data. Key activities include:

- Formulating research questions about relationships between variables
- Conducting hypothesis tests to determine statistical significance
- Analyzing the relationship between verified status and video metrics
- Drawing conclusions based on statistical evidence

### 3. Regression Analysis

In this component, we build regression models to understand relationships between variables and predict outcomes. Key activities include:

- Exploratory data analysis to check model assumptions
- Building logistic regression models using verified status as the outcome variable
- Evaluating model performance and interpreting results
- Providing business recommendations based on model insights

### 4. Classification using Machine Learning

This component focuses on building machine learning models to classify videos as claims or opinions. Key activities include:

- Feature engineering and selection
- Training and evaluating multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model optimization and hyperparameter tuning
- Ethical considerations in model development and deployment

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing information about TikTok videos, including:

- Video metadata (duration, view count, like count, share count, download count, comment count)
- Author information (verified status, ban status)
- Video content information (claim status, transcription text)

## Tools and Technologies

The project utilizes various data science tools and technologies:

- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn and XGBoost for machine learning
